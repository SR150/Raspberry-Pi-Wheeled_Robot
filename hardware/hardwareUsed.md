## Equipment needed
The robot is flexible so can be made using different hardware, as long as it is compatible with a raspberry pi. You may need to change the motor controller 
code if you use a different motor controller but all the other code should work.

### Misc
chasis for the robot. This can be anything that you can attach all the hardware to. I used a piece of plywood.

Raspberry pi (any model other than a pico will work)


### Propulsion
motor controller : I used SKU:102706  https://thepihut.com/products/3a-4v-16v-2-channel-dc-motor-driver

2x motors : I used SKU:102308 https://thepihut.com/products/micro-metal-gearmotor?variant=34651584721

method of attaching motors to the robot for example these brackets SKU: POL-989 https://thepihut.com/products/pololu-micro-metal-gearmotor-bracket-pair-black

### Wheels
2x wheels :I used SKU:POL-1087 https://thepihut.com/products/pololu-wheel-32x7mm-pair-black

back support of some kind. This can be an undriven wheel that can rotate or a ball bearing. I used SKU:105734
https://thepihut.com/products/20mm-height-metal-caster-bearing-wheel

As an alternativeto wheels tracks could be used.

### Sensor
2x reed switch

2x magnet These do not need to be very strong, just powerful enough to be detected by the reed switch.

1x resistor 200 ohm aproximately though this is fairly flexible.

optional: button

### Power
battery for raspberry pi and motor. The power for the raspberry pi can be provided by a portable phone charger. The power for the motors could be 
provided by a battery box for AA batteries or similar or a portable phone charger.
